# Numerical Analysis for Machine Learning - PoliMi
## Course Aim
Numerical methods are ubiquitous in Machine Learning. The aim of this course is twofold:
on the one hand, to systematically address the mathematical and numerical background at 
the heart of machine learning, with particular attention to applications in Science and
Engineering; on the other hand, to sustain the theoretical analysis with laboratory sessions.
Extensive hands-on sessions are planned.

### Course Program and Syllabus
1. Mathematical Representation of Neural Networks
- Multilayer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Networks, Deep Auto Encoder,
Recursive Neural Networks.

2. Numerical Linear Algebra Tools
- Singular value decomposition, principal components and best low rank matrix.
- Iterative methods for linear system of equations and preconditioning techniques
(multilevel and multigrid methods) and related convergence analysis.
- Iterative methods for computing eigenvalues: QR factorization and least-square.
- Toeplitz matrices and shift invariant filters.
- Stochastic rank reduction.

3. Approximation properties of Neural Networks
- Stone-Weierstrass theorem and universality results for shallow neural networks
- Approximation theory of deep neural networks: error bounds, optimality
properties and regularity classes (e.g, Sobolev, Besov).

4. Numerical Optimization and Training of Neural Networks
- Loss functions, back propagation and automatic differentiation: theory and
numerical aspects.
- Stochastic gradient methods, accelerated gradient methods, coordinate descent
methods.
- Second order methods (Hessian-Free Inexact Newton Methods, Stochastic Quasi-
Newton Methods, Gauss-Newton Methods, Natural Gradient Method, Methods
that employ Diagonal Scaling).
- Methods for regularized models: first-Order methods for generic convex
regularizers (iterative soft-thresholding algorithms, bound-constrained methods
for l1-norm regularized problems), second-order methods (proximal Newton
methods, orthant-based methods).

5. Sparse hints to Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning applications.

### Course Evaluation
The exam consists of a written test and an oral colloquium. The written test takes place in
the computer room. The written exam covers all the theoretical and practical arguments
considered during the lectures and lab sessions. The problems mainly focus on definition,
application of important lemmas and theorems, and important examples. Light calculations
may be needed. It is not allowed to use any form of course material. The questions will be
answered without books, notes, preparations, etc. The maximum grade of the written test is
28/30. To get a grade >= 28, students are required to an oral exam. The assessment of the
oral exam will be based on subject knowledge matters and quality of the oral delivery.
